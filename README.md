# Hot TODOs

* **Triage**
  * Things that are not absolute `v10` stop-ship should be moved to `v10-update` milestone. Current `v10` stop-ship criteria is:
    * Ones designers think absolute `v10` show stopper
    * Fixes that require breaking change of `v10` API (Note that we are striving to avoid breaking changes, though)
  * Visual review comments in PR needs to be triaged as well. Action items on this is:
    * Designers to determine what absolute no-go design review items of each PRs are
    * Remainders of the design review items will be tracked as separate issues. Each of them will be triaged
  * As we defer issues and fix issues, issues in `v10-rc1` milestone should be *zero* before we ship `v10`
* Clean up open visual/code reviews - You can utilize some of below links
* Get all open questions answered - You can utilize some of below links
* Do the following when you create PRs:
  * Assign `v10-rc` milestone to all new `v10` ship stopper issues/PRs
  * Add WIP label to all new draft PRs
  * Assigned designer for component should be set as the reviewer for any PRs that require design reviews (In addition to adding `visual review` label)
* Talk! (Designers/devs talking each other is one of the biggest treasures in Carbon team! ðŸ˜‰)
